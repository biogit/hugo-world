# Hugo World
## Hugo site incorporating Kube framework
The plan is to produce this site using *Hugo* static site generator, with styling from *Kube* CSS framework, and serve it via *Netlify* hooked into a *GitHub* repository.
Most of the files, including this one, will use [Markdown syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax "Markdown syntax reference").
